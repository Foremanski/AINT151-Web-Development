   <h1>What is a Gamebook?</h1>

      <p> A gamebook is a work of printed fiction that allows the reader to participate in the story by making <strong>choices</strong>. The
<i>narrative</i> branches along various paths, typically through the use of numbered paragraphs or pages. Production of
new gamebooks in the West <sub>decreased</sub> dramatically during the nineties as choice based stories have moved away
from <sup>print based media</sup>. </p>

    <h2> Description </h2>

      <p>  There are three types of gamebooks. <br /> The first is the branching-plot novel, which require the reader to make choices
but are otherwise like a regular novel. These Gamebooks are sometimes informally called choose your own
adventure books or CYOA which is the name of the well known Choose Your Own Adventure series originally
published by Bantam Books. <br /> The second type is the Solitaire adventure (an example of this is the Tunnels and Trolls
series of gamebooks), which combines the branching-plot novel with the rules of a role-playing game, allowing the
game to be played without a Gamemaster but may require the purchase of separate manuals. <br /> The third type is the
Adventure gamebook (examples of these are the Fighting Fantasy and Lone Wolf series of gamebooks), which
combines the branching-plot novel with a simple role-playing system unique to the book (or series). <p>

    <h3>Origins</h2>

      <p> Several influences contributed to the development of the gamebook format during the twentieth century. The
possibility of having stories branching out into several different paths seems to have been first suggested by Jorge
Luis Borges in his short story An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain (1941). This story features an author
whose novel is a three-part story containing two branch points, and with nine possible endings. Another story by
Borges, titled "The Garden of Forking Paths"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Forking_Paths">[link to page]</a>
(1941), also describes a book with a maze-like narrative reminiscent ofmodern gamebooks. These stories, however, did not carry out the idea of branching-path narrative to full execution. </p>
